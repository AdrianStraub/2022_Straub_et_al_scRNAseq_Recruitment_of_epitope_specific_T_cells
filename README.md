# 2022_Straub_et_al_scRNAseq_Recruitment_of_epitope_specific_T_cells
 
# This folder contains the notebooks for the analysis of single cell RNAseq data derived from antigen specific T cells derived from 40 C57BL/6 mice before and after antigenic stimulation with SIINFEKL peptide. This analysis is part of the paper " Recruitment of epitope-specific T cell clones with a low affinity threshold supports efficacy against mutational escape upon re-infection" by Straub et al.
